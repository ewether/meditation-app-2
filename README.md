# Meditation App

A simple meditation app where users can choose a time option, a music option, and begin their timed meditation session.

## Stack

HTML <br>
CSS <br>

## Motivation

I created this app to learn the basics of React. 

It's a simple project, but it helped me understand the general
 flow of React and the benefits it provides.
